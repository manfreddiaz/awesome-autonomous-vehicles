* [Comma.ai](https://archive.org/details/comma-dataset) - 7 and a quarter hours of largely highway driving. Consists of 10 videos clips of variable size recorded at 20 Hz with a camera mounted on the windshield of an Acura ILX 2016. In parallel to the videos, also recorded some measurements such as car's speed, acceleration, steering angle, GPS coordinates, gyroscope angles. These measurements are transformed into a uniform 100 Hz time base.
* [Oxford's Robotic Car](http://robotcar-dataset.robots.ox.ac.uk/) - over 100 repetitions of a consistent route through Oxford, UK, captured over a period of over a year. The dataset captures many different combinations of weather, traffic and pedestrians, along with longer term changes such as construction and roadworks.

The dataset contains about 30 minutes of driving. The video is 1920x1080 in colour, encoded using H.264 codec. Steering is estimated by tracking markers on the steering wheel. The car's speed is estimated from OCR the car's speedometer (but the accuracy of the method is not guaranteed).
